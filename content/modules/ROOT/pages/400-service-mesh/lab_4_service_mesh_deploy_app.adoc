== Introduction

Now that your Red Hat Service Mesh has been deployed on your ROSA cluster you can actually use it to connect the microservices of an example application. You will use the standard Service Mesh example application called `Bookinfo`.

== Create and configure a project for the service mesh

Now, let's proceed with deploying a workload to test our service mesh.

. First, let's create a project (namespace) for us to deploy our workload into.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project bookinfo
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "bookinfo" on server "https://api.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. Next, let's label that project (namespace) to enable the service mesh injection for all applications in the project.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc label namespace bookinfo istio-injection=enabled
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
namespace/bookinfo labeled
----

. Even though we've enabled service mesh injection in the project, we also need to add our project (namespace) to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, which limits the scope of the service mesh control plane to only projects in the member roll.
To add the project to the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll`, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
kind: ServiceMeshMemberRoll
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  members:
  - bookinfo
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
servicemeshmemberroll.maistra.io/default created
----

. Next, let's verify the `ServiceMeshMemberRoll` was created successfully.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n istio-system get smmr -o wide
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME      READY   STATUS       AGE   MEMBERS
default   1/1     Configured   20s   ["bookinfo"]
----
+
The service mesh member roll was successfully configured when the STATUS column is `Configured` and your project shows up in the MEMBERS column.

=== Deploy our test workload

. Now that we've configured the service mesh for our project, let's deploy our bookinfo workload into our project.
To do so, run the following command to create the necessary resources:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n bookinfo apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/rosa-workshop-content/main/rosa-content/assets/scripts/bookinfo.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
service/details created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-details created
deployment.apps/details-v1 created
service/ratings created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-ratings created
deployment.apps/ratings-v1 created
service/reviews created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-reviews created
deployment.apps/reviews-v1 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v2 created
deployment.apps/reviews-v3 created
service/productpage created
serviceaccount/bookinfo-productpage created
deployment.apps/productpage-v1 created
----
+

Check it out on GitHub https://github.com/rh-mobb/rosa-workshop-content/blob/main/rosa-content/assets/scripts/bookinfo.yaml[here].

. Now, let's create the service mesh ingress gateway.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n bookinfo apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/rosa-workshop-content/main/rosa-content/assets/scripts/bookinfo-gateway.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
gateway.networking.istio.io/bookinfo-gateway created
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/bookinfo created
----

. Next, let's add some destination rules.
Destination rules define policies that apply to traffic intended for a service after routing has occurred.
To create the rules, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n bookinfo apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-mobb/rosa-workshop-content/main/rosa-content/assets/scripts/destination-rule-all.yaml
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/productpage created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/reviews created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/ratings created
destinationrule.networking.istio.io/details created
----

== Verifying the Bookinfo installation

. First, let's verify that all pods are running and ready by running the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n bookinfo get pods
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
NAME                              READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
details-v1-7d55897577-gvwm5       2/2     Running   0          98s
productpage-v1-8648b7c9b5-txfvk   2/2     Running   0          96s
ratings-v1-84599899df-twc8g       2/2     Running   0          97s
reviews-v1-59647cf6c-pbrn8        2/2     Running   0          97s
reviews-v2-5fc469b4ff-fp4fn       2/2     Running   0          97s
reviews-v3-7d84688cc9-kktpt       2/2     Running   0          97s
----

. Next, let's get the URL for the product page.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "http://$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/productpage"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com/productpage
----
+
[WARNING]
====
This is a `http` URL. Some browsers convert that automatically to `https` and will not show the page.
====

. Copy and paste the URL provided in the previous step into your web browser and verify the Bookinfo product page is successfully deployed.
+
You should see a book review of *"The Comedy of Errors"*. If you see an "Error fetching product reviews!" message wait a little bit and then refresh the browser window. It takes a moment for the reviews service to be fully available.

*Congratulations!*

You've successfully deployed the *Bookinfo* example application to your OpenShift cluster and used the Service Mesh capabilities to configure the application.
