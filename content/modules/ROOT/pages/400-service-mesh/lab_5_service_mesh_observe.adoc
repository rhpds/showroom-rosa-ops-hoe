== Introduction

In this section you will configure and observe traffic between the micro services that make up the example application.

Requests are routed to services within a service mesh with virtual services.
Each virtual service consists of a set of routing rules that are evaluated in order.
Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh matches each given request to the virtual service to a specific real destination within the mesh.

Without virtual services, Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh distributes traffic using round-robin load balancing between all service instances.
With a virtual service, you can specify traffic behavior for one or more hostnames.
Routing rules in the virtual service tell Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh how to send the traffic for the virtual service to appropriate destinations.
Route destinations can be versions of the same service or entirely different services.

== Configuring virtual services with weighted load balancing

. Weighted load balancing requests are forwarded to instances in the pool according to a specific percentage.
In this example 80% to v1, 20% to v2.
To create a virtual service with this configuration, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat << EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
      weight: 80
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
      weight: 20
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/reviews created
----

. Refresh your browser tab containing the Bookinfo URL a few times and you'll see that occasionally you'll see the v2 of the book review app which has star ratings.
+
Accidentally close out of the tab?
No problem, run the following command to get the product page URL:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "http://$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/productpage"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
http://istio-ingressgateway-istio-system.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com/productpage

== Observe traffic using the Kiali web console

Kiali is an observability console for the OpenShift Service Mesh with service mesh configuration and validation capabilities.
It helps you understand the structure and health of your service mesh by monitoring traffic flow to infer the topology and report errors.

. First, grab the Kiali web console URL.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "https://$(oc get routes -n istio-system kiali -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/console"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://kiali-istio-system.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com/console
----

. Next, navigate to that URL in your web browser and click the `Login With OpenShift` button.

* *Admin user ID:* rosa-admin
* *Admin user Password:* {rosa_user_password}

Also note that if you are logged into OpenShift in another browser tab then single sign on will not even prompt you for credentials after you click the `Login With OpenShift` button.

Once logged in, the Kiali Overview screen presents tiles for each project namespace.

. Now, let's generate some traffic against the product page service.
To do so, run the following command in your terminal:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
while true; do curl -sSL "http://$(oc -n istio-system get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/productpage" | head -n 5; sleep 1; done
----
+
Leave the loop running and proceed to the next steps.

. Return to the Kiali web console and click the _Graph_ option in the sidebar.
. Next, select _bookinfo_ from the Namespace list, and App graph from the Graph Type list.
+

. Next, click on the _Display idle nodes_ button.
+

. Next, view the graph and change the display settings to add or remove information from the graph.
+

. Next, click the _Workload_ tab and select the _details-v1_ workload.
+

. In your terminal window stop the traffic generation by pressing `Ctrl-c`.

*Congratulations!*

You should now see traffic flowing between the various services in your bookinfo application.

This concludes the Service Mesh section of this experience.
