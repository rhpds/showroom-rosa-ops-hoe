== Introduction

In this section you will install the operators that are necessary to deploy Red Hat Service Mesh to your cluster.

== Operator Overview

Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh requires the following four Operators:

[WARNING]
====
Before moving on, ensure you have deployed all four of these operators in the order listed.
====

* *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* - Provides database storage for tracing and logging with the distributed tracing platform.
It is based on the open core Elasticsearch project. Use the `stable` channel.
* *Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform* - Provides distributed tracing to monitor and troubleshoot transactions in complex distributed systems.
It is based on the open source Jaeger project. Use the `stable` channel.
* *Kiali Operator* - Provides observability for your service mesh.
Allows you to view configurations, monitor traffic, and analyze traces in a single console.
It is based on the open source Kiali project. Use the `stable` channel.
* *Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh* - Allows you to connect, secure, control, and observe the microservices that comprise your applications.
The Service Mesh Operator defines and monitors the ServiceMeshControlPlane resources that manage the deployment, updating, and deletion of the Service Mesh components. It is based on the open source Istio project. Use the `stable` channel.

=== Operator installation Procedure

. If you are not still there open the OpenShift Container Platform web console. If you need to remind yourself of the URL you can use one of the following two commands on your bastion VM:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc whoami --show-console
----
+
or
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa describe cluster --cluster rosa-$GUID --output json | jq -r .console.url
----

. In the OpenShift Container Platform web console, click *Operators → OperatorHub.*

. For each operator in this list repeat the following steps to install the operator:
.. OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator
.. Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform (careful! There is a second one with a very similar name!)
.. Kiali Operator
.. Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh

. Type the name of the Operator into the filter box and select the *Red Hat version* of the Operator.
Community versions of the Operators are not supported.
. Click *Install*.
. On the *Install Operator* page for each Operator, accept the default settings.
. Click *Install*.
. Wait until the Operator has installed before repeating the steps for the next Operator in the list.

* The *OpenShift Elasticsearch Operator* is installed in the `openshift-operators-redhat` namespace and is available for all namespaces in the cluster.
* The *Red Hat OpenShift distributed tracing platform* is installed in the `openshift-distributed-tracing` namespace and is available for all namespaces in the cluster.
* The *Kiali* operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace and are available for all namespaces in the cluster.
* The *Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh* Operator is installed in the `openshift-operators` namespace and are available for all namespaces in the cluster.

. After all you have installed all four Operators, click *Operators → Installed Operators* to verify that your Operators installed.
