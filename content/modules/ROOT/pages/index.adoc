== ROSA Hands-on Experience: Take advantage of a Modern Application Platform with ROSA

In this experience, you will learn how you can take advantage of Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) as a turnkey application platform and integrate with other AWS services to build, deploy, scale and manage applications in a native AWS environment. 

*Who this workshop is for:* This experience is aimed at Platform Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Cloud Operations, Architects, and Developers that want to learn what makes a modern application platform, and how they can leverage cloud services to streamline the delivery and operations of their application platforms.

*What to expect:* During the workshop, we will take you through a series of hands on exercises to help you understand some of the concepts of modern application platforms.

*What you will learn:*

. Explore the ROSA environment that has been predeployed for you.
. Complete Day 2 operations tasks including: configuring node and cluster scaling policies, configuring managed upgrades, configuring single-sign-on for the cluster using Amazon Cognito, and forwarding logs to Amazon CloudWatch.
. Deploy an application that uses AWS IAM Roles for Service Accounts and AWS STS to connect to an Amazon DynamoDB table.
. Make an application on OpenShift scalable and resistant to node failures and upgrades.
. Deploy an application using CI/CD tooling, including OpenShift GitOps and Source-to-Image, and use labels for deterministic app placement on nodes.
. Learn how to use OpenShift Service Mesh for application observability and tracing.

After completing this workshop, you will understand the concepts of modern application platforms, and will have begun to lay the foundations with Red Hat OpenShift.

[NOTE]
====
Although this experience is focused on the command line, most if not all of these actions can be done from the OpenShift Console as well.
