== Introduction

It's time for us to put our cluster to work and deploy a workload! We're going to build an example Java application, https://github.com/redhat-mw-demos/microsweeper-quarkus/tree/ROSA[microsweeper], using https://quarkus.io/[Quarkus] (a Kubernetes-native Java stack) and https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb[Amazon DynamoDB]. We'll then deploy the application to our ROSA cluster and connect to the database over AWS's secure network.

This lab demonstrates how ROSA (an AWS native service) can easily and securely access and utilize other AWS native services using AWS Secure Token Service (STS). To achieve this, we will be using AWS IAM, Amazon DynamoDB, and a service account within OpenShift. After configuring the latter, we will use both Quarkus - a Kubernetes-native Java framework optimized for containers - and Source-to-Image (S2I) - a toolkit for building container images from source code - to deploy the microsweeper application.

== Create an Amazon DynamoDB instance

. First, let's create a project (also known as namespace). A project is a unit of organization within OpenShift that provides isolation for applications and resources. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project microsweeper-ex
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "microsweeper-ex" on server "https://api.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. Next, create the Amazon DynamoDB table resource. Amazon DynamoDB will be used to store information from our application and ROSA will utilize AWS Secure Token Service(STS) to access this native service. More information on STS and how it is utilized in ROSA will be provided in the next section. For now lets create the Amazon DynamoDB table, To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws dynamodb create-table \
  --table-name microsweeper-scores-$GUID \
  --attribute-definitions AttributeName=name,AttributeType=S \
  --key-schema AttributeName=name,KeyType=HASH \
  --provisioned-throughput ReadCapacityUnits=1,WriteCapacityUnits=1
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,json,options=nowrap,subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "TableDescription": {
        "AttributeDefinitions": [
            {
                "AttributeName": "name",
                "AttributeType": "S"
            }
        ],
        "TableName": "microsweeper-scores-{guid}",
        "KeySchema": [
            {
                "AttributeName": "name",
                "KeyType": "HASH"
            }
        ],
        "TableStatus": "CREATING",
        "CreationDateTime": 1681832377.864,
        "ProvisionedThroughput": {
            "NumberOfDecreasesToday": 0,
            "ReadCapacityUnits": 1,
            "WriteCapacityUnits": 1
        },
        "TableSizeBytes": 0,
        "ItemCount": 0,
        "TableArn": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:{rosa_sandbox_account_id}:table/microsweeper-scores-{guid}",
        "TableId": "37be72fe-3dea-411c-871d-467c12607691"
    }
}

== IAM Roles for Service Account (IRSA) Configuration

Our application uses AWS Secure Token Service(STS) to establish connections with Amazon DynamoDB. Traditionally, one would use static IAM credentials for this purpose, but this approach goes against AWS' recommended best practices. Instead, AWS suggests utilizing their Secure Token Service (STS). Fortunately, our ROSA cluster has already been deployed using AWS STS, making it effortless to adopt IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA), also known as pod identity.

Service accounts play a crucial role in managing the permissions and access control of applications running within ROSA. They act as identities for pods and allow them to interact securely with various AWS services.

IAM roles, on the other hand, define a set of permissions that can be assumed by trusted entities within AWS. By associating an AWS IAM role with a service account, we enable the pods in our ROSA cluster to leverage the permissions defined within that role. This means that instead of relying on static IAM credentials, our application can obtain temporary security tokens from AWS STS by assuming the associated IAM role.

This approach aligns with AWS' recommended best practices and provides several benefits. Firstly, it enhances security by reducing the risk associated with long-lived static credentials. Secondly, it simplifies the management of access controls by leveraging IAM roles, which can be centrally managed and easily updated. Finally, it enables seamless integration with AWS services, such as DynamoDB, by granting the necessary permissions to the service accounts associated with our pods.

. First, create a service account to use to assume an IAM role.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex create serviceaccount microsweeper
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
serviceaccount/microsweeper created
----

. An AWS IAM role has been set up for your service account to use. This role includes permissions to access the DynamoDB database that you created in the previous section. The role that has been created is called `irsa-$GUID`. You will need the *ARN* of that role to associate it with the `microsweeper` service account.

. Examine the role that has been created for you:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws iam get-role --role-name irsa-$GUID --output json
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,json,subs="attributes"]
----
{
    "Role": {
        "Path": "/",
        "RoleName": "irsa-{guid}",
        "RoleId": "AROAYA6CBKHNIX2KS3MKM",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::{rosa_sandbox_account_id}:role/irsa-{guid}",
        "CreateDate": "2023-10-04T09:41:29+00:00",
        "AssumeRolePolicyDocument": {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Principal": {
                        "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::{rosa_sandbox_account_id}:oidc-provider/rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/26le04kvuuni19cln8ojurfe98j02p3l"
                    },
                    "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
                    "Condition": {
                        "StringEquals": {
                            "rh-oidc.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/26le04kvuuni19cln8ojurfe98j02p3l:sub": "system:serviceaccount:microsweeper-ex:microsweeper"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        "Description": "IRSA Role ({guid})",
        "MaxSessionDuration": 3600,
        "RoleLastUsed": {}
    }
}
----
+
Note how the service account `microsweeper` in the namespace `microsweeper-ex` has been granted the permissions to assume the role. Also note that creating this service account in another namespace would therefore not work to elevate the service account's permissions.

. Get the Role ARN:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ROLE_ARN=$(aws iam get-role --role-name irsa-$GUID --output json | jq -r .Role.Arn)

echo $ROLE_ARN
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
arn:aws:iam::{rosa_sandbox_account_id}:role/irsa-{guid}
----

. Now you can annotate the service account with the ARN of the pre-created IAM role.
To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex annotate serviceaccount microsweeper eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=$ROLE_ARN
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
serviceaccount/microsweeper annotated
----

== Deploy the Microsweeper app

Now that we've got a DynamoDB instance up and running and our IRSA configuration completed, let's deploy our application.

The example application that we use is a Quarkus application. You can find the source code for the application at https://github.com/rhpds/rosa-workshop-app.git. But for the purposes of this experience you will be deploying a pre-built container image.

. Create the *microsweeper-appservice* `Deployment`:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: microsweeper-appservice
  namespace: microsweeper-ex
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      deployment: microsweeper-appservice
      app.kubernetes.io/name: microsweeper-appservice
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        deployment: microsweeper-appservice
        app.kubernetes.io/name: microsweeper-appservice
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: microsweeper
      containers:
      - name: microsweeper-appservice
        env:
        - name: AWS_REGION
          value: $(aws configure get region)
        - name: DYNAMODB_AWS_CREDENTIALS_TYPE
          value: default
        - name: DYNAMODB_TABLE
          value: microsweeper-scores-$GUID
        image: quay.io/rhpds/microsweeper:1.0.0
        imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent        
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
          protocol: TCP
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
deployment.apps/microsweeper-appservice created
----
+
[TIP]
====
The application is configured using environment variables and the service account name.

* `serviceAccountName: microsweeper` tells OpenShift to use the service account that you configured previously to run this pod.
* `AWS_REGION` tells the application in which region the database table is deployed.
* `DYNAMODB_AWS__CREDENTIALS_TYPE` tells the Quarkus database client to look for credentials in the usual places (amongst which is our service account)
* `DYNAMODB_TABLE` is the name of the database table that you previously created.
====

. Now that your application is running we need to make the application accessible outside of your OpenShift clusterso that you can test it.
+
Create the `Service` for the application:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex expose deployment microsweeper-appservice
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
service/microsweeper-appservice exposed
----

. And finally create a `Route` that publishes this application. This particular route will have TLS encryption (`edge`) and redirect `http` requests to `https` (`Redirect)`.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n microsweeper-ex create route edge --service=microsweeper-appservice --insecure-policy=Redirect
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
route.route.openshift.io/microsweeper-appservice created
----

=== Test the application

. Get the the URL for your application route:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "https://$(oc -n microsweeper-ex get route microsweeper-appservice -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----

.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://microsweeper-appservice-microsweeper-ex.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. Use the returned URL to open the Microsweeper application in a web browser of your choice.
+
You should be able to play a few games and have the score persist in the database.

=== Application IP

Let's take a quick look at what IP the application resolves to.

Back in your terminal, run the following command:

[source,sh,role=execute]
----
nslookup $(oc -n microsweeper-ex get route microsweeper-appservice -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
----

.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Server:         192.168.0.2
Address:        192.168.0.2#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   microsweeper-appservice-microsweeper-ex.apps.rosa.rosa-7v44k.u7g2.p3.openshiftapps.com
Address: 3.21.3.12
----

Notice the IP address;
can you guess where it comes from?

It comes from the ROSA Load Balancer.
In this workshop, we are using a public cluster which means the load balancer is exposed to the Internet.
If this was a private cluster, you would have to have connectivity to the VPC ROSA is running on.
This could be via a VPN connection, AWS DirectConnect, or something else.

== Summary

Here you learned:

* Create an AWS DynamoDB table for your application to use
* Create a service account to use IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)
* Deploy the Microsweeper application and connect it to AWS DynamoDB as the backend database
* Access the publicly exposed Microsweeper app using OpenShift routes
