== Introduction

Red Hat® OpenShift® GitOps is an operator that provides tools to enable continuous deployment (CD). Making GitOps workflows available to your platform and development teams, OpenShift GitOps helps you to realize faster, more secure, and more scalable software development, without compromising on quality.

OpenShift GitOps enables customers to build and integrate declarative, git-driven CD workflows directly into their development lifecycle. 

There's no single tool that converts a development pipeline to "DevOps", but implementing a GitOps framework starts you on the path. Updates and changes are made declaratively in code, bringing automation and a single source of truth to your infrastructure, configuration, and application deployments.

OpenShift GitOps is built on https://argoproj.github.io/cd[Argo CD], integrating it into Red Hat OpenShift to deliver a consistent, fully supported, declarative, cloud native platform for deployment using GitOps principles.

OpenShift with OpenShift GitOps enables you to:

* Apply consistency across cluster and deployment lifecycles
* Consolidate administration and management of applications across on-premises and cloud environments
* Monitor the state deployed applications across your clusters
* Roll back code changes across clusters
* Roll out new changes submitted via Git
* Have confidence in the state of your resources

== Deploying your Application with OpenShift GitOps

. From the OpenShift Console Administrator view click through *HOME* \-> *Operators* \-> *Operator Hub*, search for "openshift gitops" and click *Install*.
+
For the update channel select *gitops-1.10*. Leave all other defaults and click *Install*.
+

. Wait until the operator shows as successfully installed (*Installed operator - ready for use*).

. In your terminal create a new project:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc new-project bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Now using project "bgd" on server "https://api.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com:6443".

You can add applications to this project with the 'new-app' command. For example, try:

    oc new-app rails-postgresql-example

to build a new example application in Ruby. Or use kubectl to deploy a simple Kubernetes application:

    kubectl create deployment hello-node --image=k8s.gcr.io/e2e-test-images/agnhost:2.33 -- /agnhost serve-hostname
----

. The OpenShift GitOps operator includes the capability to deploy individual instances of Argo CD for developers.
+
Deploy your personal Argo CD into your development project:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1beta1
kind: ArgoCD
metadata:
  name: argocd
  namespace: bgd
spec:
  sso:
    dex:
      openShiftOAuth: true
      resources:
        limits:
          cpu: 500m
          memory: 256Mi
        requests:
          cpu: 250m
          memory: 128Mi
    provider: dex
  rbac:
    defaultPolicy: "role:readonly"
    policy: "g, system:authenticated, role:admin"
    scopes: "[groups]"
  server:
    insecure: true
    route:
      enabled: true
      tls:
        insecureEdgeTerminationPolicy: Redirect
        termination: edge
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
argocd.argoproj.io/argocd created
----

. Wait for your Argo CD server to be ready:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc rollout status deploy/argocd-server -n bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "argocd-server" successfully rolled out
----

. Now that your Argo CD server is ready you can use it to deploy an application from a git repository. In this case the Kubernetes / OpenShift definition of the application is in the git repository https://github.com/rh-mobb/gitops-bgd-app. We won't have time to go into all the options, but creating the `Application` tells Argo CD to deploy the application from the git repository into the namespace `bgd`.
+
Create the Application:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
---
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: bgd-app
  namespace: bgd
spec:
  destination:
    namespace: bgd
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
  project: default
  source:
    path: apps/bgd/base
    repoURL: https://github.com/rh-mobb/gitops-bgd-app
    targetRevision: main
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: false
    syncOptions:
    - CreateNamespace=false
EOF
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
application.argoproj.io/bgd-app created
----

. Retrieve the URL for your Argo CD dashboard and navigate to it in your web browser:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "https://$(oc -n bgd get route argocd-server -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
https://argocd-server-bgd.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. Argo CD is configured for single sign on with OpenShift. Therefore your admin credentials also work in Argo CD. Click on the *Log in via OpenShift* button and use the admin credentials to log in (you may need to click on *Allow selected permissions* after the login step):
+
[subs="attributes"]
====
* *Admin user ID:* rosa-admin
* *Admin user Password:* {rosa_user_password}
====

. Once you have logged into Argo CD you should see the Argo CD application dashboard.
+

. Click on the Application `bgd-app` to show its topology.
+
image::argo_sync.png[]

. Verify that OpenShift sees the Deployment as rolled out:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc rollout status deploy/bgd
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment "bgd" successfully rolled out
----

. Get the route and browse to it in your browser:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
echo "http://$(oc -n bgd get route bgd -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')"
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
bgd-bgd.apps.rosa-6n4s8.1c1c.p1.openshiftapps.com
----

. You should see a green box in the website like so:
+
image::bgd_green.png[]

. Patch the OpenShift resource to force it to be out of sync with the GitHub repository:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc -n bgd patch deploy/bgd --type='json' \
  -p='[{"op": "replace", "path":
  "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env/0/value", "value":"blue"}]'
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
deployment.apps/bgd patched
----

. Refresh your browser and you should see a blue box in the website like so:
+
image::app_blue.png[]

. Meanwhile check Argo CD - it should show the application as out of sync. Click the *Sync* button and then click on *Synchronize* to have it revert the change you made in OpenShift:
+
image::sync_bgd.png[]

. Check again, you should see a green box in the website like so:
+
image::bgd_green.png[]

*Congratulations!*

You have successfully deployed Red Hat OpenShift GitOps and used it to deploy and heal an application to your ROSA cluster.
