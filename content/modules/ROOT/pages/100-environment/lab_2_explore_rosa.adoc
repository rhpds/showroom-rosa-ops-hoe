== Explore your ROSA environment

In this Hands on experience ROSA has already been pre-installed for you.

This was done both for speed of deployment but also for security reasons because your AWS user does not have sufficient permissions to deploy a new ROSA cluster - only enough to follow these lab instructions

If you are interested would like to know more about the installation there is a https://youtu.be/gAMr3sI5bdY?si=eD12Ab0XUJvCBrHR[video] explaining the process.

All interactions with ROSA happen through the `rosa` CLI (or on the Red Hat Console web page - to which you also do not have access). So let's use the CLI to explore what you have.

. List all deployed ROSA clusters in the AWS account:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa list clusters
----
+
ifeval::["{rosa_deploy_hcp}" == "true"]
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap,subs="attributes"]
----
ID                                NAME        STATE  TOPOLOGY
26rb36mq3avdbitdo3qv3t7sc7s4ui16  rosa-{guid}  ready  Hosted CP
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{rosa_deploy_hcp}" == "false"]
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap,subs=attributes]
----
ID                                NAME        STATE  TOPOLOGY
26rate9v2s9k7mjgtag8gcoh3kkdl6qj  rosa-{guid}  ready  Classic (STS)
----
endif::[]
+
[TIP]
====
The ID of your cluster will be different than in the sample output above.

Also notice the Topology and state. State should be *ready* and Topology could be either *Classic (STS)* or *Hosted CP* which stands for Hosted Control Plane - a new, resource saving way of deploying a ROSA cluster.
====

. Now let's examine this cluster a bit more by describing the cluster (the `$GUID` environment variable is already set for you so you can immediately describe your individual cluster):
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa describe cluster --cluster rosa-$GUID
----
+
ifeval::["{rosa_deploy_hcp}" == "false"]
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]

Note that not all values in the sample output will match exactly your environment.

. Get the API URL for your cluster:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa describe cluster --cluster rosa-$GUID --output json | jq -r .api.url
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
{rosa_api_url}
----

. Get the OpenShift Console URL for your cluster:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa describe cluster --cluster rosa-$GUID --output json | jq -r .console.url
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,subs="attributes"]
----
{rosa_console_url}
----

. A temporary admin user has already been created for you on the ROSA OpenShift cluster. 
+
[subs="attributes"]
====
* *Admin user ID:* {rosa_admin_user}
* *Admin user Password:* {rosa_admin_password}
====
+
[NOTE]
====
On a brand new ROSA deploy you would use the `rosa create admin -c rosa-{guid}` command to create this admin user.

For this environment your admin user has already been created.
====

. Now that you have the information about the Admin credentials and the API URL for your cluster you can log into your cluster:
+
[source,sh,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
oc login --username {rosa_admin_user} --password {rosa_admin_password} {rosa_api_url}
----
+
ifeval::["{rosa_deploy_hcp}" == "true"]
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
Login successful.

You have access to 77 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----
endif::[]
ifeval::["{rosa_deploy_hcp}" == "false"]
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
Login successful.

You have access to 100 projects, the list has been suppressed. You can list all projects with 'oc projects'

Using project "default".
Welcome! See 'oc help' to get started.
----
endif::[]

. To check that you are logged in as the admin user you can run `oc whoami`:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc whoami
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap,subs="attributes"]
----
{rosa_admin_user}
----

. You can now use the cluster as an admin user, which would suffice for this hands-on experience. Though, for any other use, it is highly recommended to set up an IdP. Which is why you will set up external authentication in the next module.

=== Login to the OpenShift Web Console

Next, let's log in to the OpenShift Web Console. Remember that you used the `rosa` command before to retrieve the console URL.

However once you are logged into the cluster you can also use the OpenShift command to find out the console URL.

. Grab your cluster's web console URL. To do so, run the following command:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc whoami --show-console
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap,subs="attributes"]
----
{rosa_console_url}
----

. Next, open the printed URL in a web browser.
. Enter the credentials from the previous section:
* Username: `{rosa_admin_user}`
* Password: `{rosa_admin_password}`

If you don't see an error, congratulations! You're now logged into the cluster and ready to move on to the workshop content.
