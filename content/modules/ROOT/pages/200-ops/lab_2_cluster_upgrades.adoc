== Introduction

Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA) provides fully-managed cluster upgrades. The ROSA Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Team will monitor and manage all ROSA cluster upgrades. Customers get status emails from the SRE team before, during, and after the upgrade. These updates can be scheduled from the OpenShift Cluster Manager (OCM) or from the ROSA CLI.

During ROSA upgrades, one node is upgraded at a time. This is done to ensure customer applications are not impacted during the update, when deployed in a highly-available and fault-tolerant method.

There are two ways to upgrade a ROSA cluster - using OpenShift Cluster Manager or using the `rosa` CLI. In this lab environment we do not have access to the OpenShift Cluster Manager so we will use the `rosa` CLI.

== Upgrade using the `rosa` command line interface

. Remind yourself of the version of your cluster:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Client Version: 4.14.1
Kustomize Version: v5.0.1
Server Version: 4.14.1
Kubernetes Version: v1.27.6+f67aeb3
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Actual versions displayed in your environment will be different than the example above.
====

. List available versions for the ROSA upgrade (depending on when you run this command there may not be any upgrades available):
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa list upgrades -c rosa-$GUID
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
I: There are no available upgrades for cluster 'rosa-7v44k'
----

. You can also use the OpenShift CLI to list available versions - but for ROSA it's preferred to use the rosa cli.:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc adm upgrade
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Cluster version is 4.14.1

Upstream is unset, so the cluster will use an appropriate default.
Channel: stable-4.14 (available channels: candidate-4.14, candidate-4.15, eus-4.14, fast-4.14, stable-4.14)
No updates available. You may still upgrade to a specific release image with --to-image or wait for new updates to be available.
Recommended updates:

  VERSION     IMAGE
  4.14.2      quay.io/openshift-release-dev/ocp-release@sha256:38ccab25d5895a216a465a9f297541fbbebe7aa115fdaa9f2015c8d5a5d036eb
----
+
Depending on when you run this command the available version list may be longer than just the next release.
+
Or there may not be any available upgrades at all. In that case you are already on the latest minor release for your major OpenShift release and can not upgrade your cluster any further. Please read through the rest of these instructions and then move on to the next lab.

. Set a variable for the cluster version you want to upgrade to. For the example above this would be:
+
[source,sh]
----
export CLUSTER_VERSION=4.14.2
----

. You probably don't want to actually upgrade the cluster right now since that may disrupt your lab environment. Luckily it is possible to schedule an update at a less inconvenient time.
+
Get a date and time that is 24 hours from now:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
export UPGRADE_DATE=$(date -d "+24 hours" '+%Y-%m-%d')
export UPGRADE_TIME=$(date '+%H:%M')

echo Date: $UPGRADE_DATE, Time: $UPGRADE_TIME
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Date: 2023-10-31, Time: 11:09
----

. Now schedule the cluster upgrade to the latest version that is shown in the list of available versions (in the example above that is `4.14.2`).
+

*Congratulations!*

You've successfully scheduled an upgrade of your cluster for tomorrow at this time. While the hands-on environment will be deleted before then, you now have the experience to schedule upgrades in the future.

=== Red Hat OpenShift Upgrade Graph Tool

Occasionally, you may be not be able to go directly from your current version to a desired version. In these cases, you must first upgrade your cluster from your current version, to an intermediary version, and then to your desired version. To help you navigate these decisions, you can take advantage of the https://access.redhat.com/labs/ocpupgradegraph/update_path_rosa[Red Hat OpenShift Upgrade Graph Tool,window=_blank].

image::rosa_upgrade_graph.png[ROSA Upgrade Graph Tool Screenshot]

In this scenario to upgrade your cluster from version 4.11.0 to 4.12.15, you must first upgrade to 4.11.39, then you can upgrade to 4.12.15. The ROSA Upgrade Graph Tool helps you easily see which version you should upgrade to.
